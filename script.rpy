    d "Late, sorry. Traffic was a nightmare. Snow everywhere, the highway closed…"
    o "Yeah, yeah, we know, same for everyone. You're the only senior officer who happens to be there today actually."
    d "That means I'm going to get all the worst cases, ain't I?"
    o "Indeed. First-degree murder. Here's the file. The suspects are already waiting for you in the interrogation room."
    d "Have pity of me and make them wait 10 more minutes, time to read that and get a coffee."

    "The officer agrees, but I'm sadly forced to discard the second part of the plan. The old-school percolator is empty and I don't have time enough to prepare a new batch of hot liquid energy."
    "To add insult to my withdrawal symptoms, today's affair is coffee related. As in, someone got killed in a coffee shop."
